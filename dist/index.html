    <!-- Add Tailwind via CDN for simplicity since we didn't fully set up postcss/tailwind config yet, 
         or we can set it up properly. 
         Given the user has `bg-indigo-50` etc in the code, they rely on Tailwind. 
         Let's stick to a proper setup plan or add CDN for now to minimize file creation?
         The plan said "Configure Vite". Let's assume standard CSS processing. 
         Wait, I added tailwindcss to package.json. I should also add tailwind.config.js and index.css if I want it to work properly. 
         
         Let's add the tailwind CDN script for immediate gratification or set up the config. 
         Setting up config is robust. 
         For this step, let's just point to main.jsx.
